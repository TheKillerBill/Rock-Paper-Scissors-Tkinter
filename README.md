# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First Program made to get used to the properties of Tkinter

This is a rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer with the score of both players tracked and displayed on the screen.
This program was interpreted by Python 3.9 so it won't work on older OS like Windows 7. Source code is included.
